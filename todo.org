  The characters tagged with either kPrimaryNumeric,
  kAccountingNumeric, or kOtherNumeric are given the property value
  Numeric_Type=Numeric, and the Numeric_Value indicated in those tags.

  Most characters have these numeric properties based on values from
  UnicodeData.txt.

* Miscellaneous code tasks [7/8]
** DONE Switch age to enum
Then convert it to Version if desired.
** DONE Add missing instances to enums
CLOSED: [2019-11-09 Сб 22:51]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-09 Сб 22:51]
:END:
Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Enum, Bounded, Data, Generic, Ix.
** DONE Pretty-print C code
This can be done either manually, by splitting long arrays, or using
some pretty-printing library, such as =pretty=.
** TODO Switch to cross-platform path construction
Currently quite a number of places hard-code ~/~.
** DONE Investigate storing the offset from the current code point for
simple case mappings; these should change less often.  Don't know
what to do about full ones.
** DONE Revamp benchmarks
CLOSED: [2019-07-25 Чт 17:10]

:END:
I am deeply worried that all of the actual property lookup is getting
optimised away, and the perceived gains over ICU are all due to the
fact that GHC can't actually do that for FFI.
** DONE Investigate using ~tagToEnum#~ instead of ~toEnum~ in ~retrieve~ functions
CLOSED: [2019-11-15 Пт 14:56]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-15 Пт 14:56]
:END:
This should omit redundant (if we set our tables up correctly) bounds
checks and accelerate the whole thing somewhat.  Somewhat similar in
spirit to using ~:%~ instead of ~%~ in numeric value property.
** DONE Consider switching to =megaparsec=
CLOSED: [2019-11-24 Вс 22:55]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-24 Вс 22:55]
:END:
Or any other parser combinator library with good error messages.  One
consistent feature of parsing UCD files so far was uninformative
~endOfInput~ error message on parse failure; this is somewhat
tolerable when actively working on them, less so when a whole bunch of
parses will suddenly fail after UCD updates or something.

I vaguely remember one of the parsers explicitly depending on
=attoparsec='s automatic backtracking, so that will need to be fixed.
* Organisational tasks [4/4]
** DONE Use ~extracted/~ files for numeric properties
CLOSED: [2019-11-24 Вс 23:34]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2019-11-24 Вс 23:34]

That will cut the dependency on Unihan.
** DONE Remove the explicit version dependence
CLOSED: [2019-11-25 Пн 00:13]
:LOGBOOK:

Currently, everything hardcodes =latest= as a path component; I probably don't want that.
** DONE Sort out fetch scripts
CLOSED: [2019-11-25 Пн 00:50]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2019-11-25 Пн 00:50]
:END:
If the above is done, we'll only really need to download and unzip
=UCD.zip=; the script should probably take an argument to specify
version.  Oh, and =ucd.nounihan.grouped.zip= XML version.
** DONE Move =ucd-gen= to a separate .cabal package
CLOSED: [2019-11-27 Ср 14:38]

So it doesn't show up on Hackage and does not end up confusing anyone.
* TODO Other UCD Files
UCD contains an enormous amount of various crap: emoji sources, tangut
sources, named sequences, and so on.  I have no idea if it is of any
high-level use, but if I want to seriously claim to offer a
comprehensive UCD interface, I suppose I have to somehow offer access
to all of those as well.  Maybe in some sort of =ucd-extras= package,
I don't know.
* TODO Unihan
It is, generally speaking, a part of UCD, so…

Since Unihan contains a number of UTF8-encoded fields, it may be
useful to place it into a separate package, which depends on a
=unistrings= library.  So the overall dependency chain will be like
this: =unihan ⟶ unistrings ⟶ ucd=.

The core problem is that the bottom layer is always assigned the same
type, regardless of the partitioning used for the trie, because the
set of values is always the same.  This is not too much of a problem
for simple enum-like types, but will lead to a /lot/ of duplicated
work for Name.  Therefore, it needs to happen as a separate pass.

The plan is roughly as follows:
- [X] Move away from TTG, and instead just give Trie two type
  parameters for annotations.
- [X] Teach mkTrieM to take into account user-provided annotation for
  the bottom layer.
- [X] Split existing typing functions into /one/ function for
  annotating previous layers, and many type-specific functions for
  calculating annotations for the original vector.
- [X] Profit.
